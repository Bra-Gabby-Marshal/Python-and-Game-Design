ASSIGNMENT 4th May, 2024

1. Method Override and Adding a Method:
Define a superclass Item with a method display_info() that returns "Item information". Create a subclass Book inheriting from Item with attributes title, 
author, and isbn. Override the display_info() method in the Book class to return the title, author, and ISBN of the book. Additionally, add a method 
check_availability() to the Book class that returns whether the book is available or not based on a boolean attribute available.

2. Set Attribute Values with Properties:
Create a class Library with a list attribute books to store instances of the Book class. Implement a method add_book() to add a new book to the library. 
Implement a property available_books that returns a list of available books (books with available attribute set to True). Write a program to create an 
instance of the Library class, add some books using the add_book() method, and display the list of available books using the available_books property.

3. Types of Methods:
Define a class LibraryMember with attributes name and borrowed_books (a list). Implement the following methods:
An instance method borrow_book(self, book) that adds the given book to the borrowed_books list.
A class method calculate_fine(cls, days) that calculates the fine amount based on the number of days overdue (assume a fixed fine rate per day).
A static method print_borrowed_books(books) that takes a list of books and prints their titles.
Write a program to demonstrate the usage of each method.

4. Application of Properties:
Create a class StudentLibraryCard with attributes student_id and borrow_limit. Implement properties for both attributes, ensuring that the student ID 
is a non-negative integer and the borrow limit is a positive integer. Write a program to create an instance of the StudentLibraryCard class, set its attributes 
using the properties, and display the student ID and borrow limit.
